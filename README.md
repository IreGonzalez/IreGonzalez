### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**IreGonzalez/IreGonzalez** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about front-end
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I could grow up
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a new job
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about everything that want to know about me
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: irenegonzalezpinilla@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love create things with my hands and know how things are made
-->

I am working on it so I ask for a little patience to finish it. Thanks
